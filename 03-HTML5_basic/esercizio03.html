        Hi there! I'm <strong>Alessia Ferrara</strong>, a student at the
        <em>University of Naples “Parthenope”</em>.
        I’ve always been curious about how things work — especially computers.
        I love experimenting with code, breaking things (accidentally!), and then
        figuring out how to fix them again.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m passionate about technology, creativity, and late-night debugging
        sessions that usually end with realizing I just missed a semicolon.
        One day, I hope to become a web developer — but for now,
        I’m just enjoying the ride and learning as much as I can!
    </p>

    <p><strong>Raffaele Montella</strong> is an Italian computer scientist and full professor of computer science at the University of
        Naples “Parthenope.” He is internationally recognized for his work in high-performance computing (HPC),
        scientific workflows, and environmental computational modeling.</p>
    <p>His research focuses on the integration of HPC, cloud, and edge computing for large-scale simulations and
        data-driven applications, particularly in marine and atmospheric sciences. Montella conceived and implemented
        DAGonStar, a workflow engine for distributed scientific computing, and contributed to the development of
        meteo@uniparthenope, a leading operational center for weather and marine forecasts in Southern Italy.</p>
    <p>He has coordinated and participated in numerous national and European research projects, often bridging the gap
        between AI, environmental modeling, and e-Science infrastructures. Beyond research, he is active in education
        innovation, promoting gamification in programming learning through initiatives like FGPE++.</p>
    <p>Montella is also an author and science communicator, known for blending technology, environment, and culture in
        both his academic and creative works, including his book “L’Isola che forse c’è.”</p>
