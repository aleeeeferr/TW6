        Hi there! I'm <strong>Alessia Ferrara</strong>, a student at the
        <em>University of Naples “Parthenope”</em>.
        I’ve always been curious about how things work — especially computers.
        I love experimenting with code, breaking things (accidentally!), and then
        figuring out how to fix them again.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m passionate about technology, creativity, and late-night debugging
        sessions that usually end with realizing I just missed a semicolon.
        One day, I hope to become a web developer — but for now,
        I’m just enjoying the ride and learning as much as I can!
